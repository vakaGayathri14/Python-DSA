Docstring for 1.3 Recursion Basics.Recursion problems.3.Print N to 1 without Loop

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-n-to-1-without-loop/1

Print numbers from N to 1 (space separated) without the help of loops.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from N to 1 recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (Recursive).

Constraint
1<=n<=1000

    def printNos(self, n):

        if n == 0:
            return
        print(n, end=" ")
        self.printNos(n - 1)


obj = Solution()
obj.printNos(10)
