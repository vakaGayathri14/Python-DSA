Bubble Sort
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 59.33%Submissions: 331K+Points: 2Average Time: 15m
Given an array, arr[]. Sort the array using bubble sort algorithm.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]
Explanation: After Sorting the array in ascending order of their values is [1, 3, 4, 7, 9].

Input: arr[] = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Explanation: Sort the array in ascending order of their values.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Explanation: An array that is already sorted should remain unchanged after applying bubble sort.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 103
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 103
